## Hello there 👋

My name is Corey and I'm passionate about digital privacy and helping people reclaim theirs. I've been working on some tools and projects to help myself and others flex our privacy rights with the services we use and the data brokers that "use" us.

## Projects
* **Privacy Poodle** *(in progress)*: a program that introduces users to the different data rights afforded to them by the CCPA, VCDPA, and GDPR and automatically submits data requests by email to up to 200 data brokers and people search sites, saving time and money for data subjects

* [**Privacy Policy Directory**](https://privacypolicy.directory/home): a categorized list of over 400+ companies and their associated privacy policies and how users can (usuaully) easily submit data subject requests with each company

* [**Privacy Policy Web Scraper**](https://github.com/coreystone/privacypolicy-scraper): scrapes websites to automatically locate and analyze their privacy policies, identifying interesting data points including opt-out/request/delete forms, email addresses, and CCPA metrics
